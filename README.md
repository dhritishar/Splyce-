Splyce

  Splyce is a comprehensive soccer analysis service that provides clients with data and insights on various aspects of the sport. It uses advanced statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time data on team and player performance, including passing accuracy, shooting efficiency, defensive pressure, and more. Splyce also offers a range of tools to help clients track performance over time, including player and team rankings, head-to-head analysis, and season-long statistics. Clients can access their analysis data through a user-friendly dashboard, making it accessible to both experts and casual fans alike.
  
  As soccer lovers, we want to integrate real-time soccer analytics into our platform to provide users with the most up-to-date data on team and player performance. However, collecting, processing, and analyzing large amounts of soccer data can be challenging, and requires advanced statistical analysis tools and machine learning algorithms.

To make it simple and more fun, we came up the idea of Splyce, which  provides us with real-time data and insights on various aspects of team and player performance.We can use this data to inform our algorithms and provide our users with the most accurate and up-to-date information possible.​

Using Splyce has allowed us to enhance our platform's functionality and provide our users with a more valuable service. We can integrate Splyce’s to the sport analysis tools/API and  allowing our users to access real-time data and insights on their favorite teams and players in order to see the whole picture more clearly. 

  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
